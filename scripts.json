But I gotta just spread the news and this breach is actually really crazy because the emails, watches, search terms, video titles, bro. And location basically the complete activity record of users is there in the breach. The good news though is they didn't get your passwords. They didn't get the payment information. So you might be like, oh, so I'm good. First of all, you're beyond cooked. There's a lot of problems here that we got to fix. But let's talk about the technical aspect. Since they have your email and they don't have your passwords, they can cross-reference your email with other data breaches that have passwords in them. So let's say you use the same email across Facebook, and then they can go and see a Facebook or a Meta data breach that happened a couple years ago. And then from there they can get your password. Or worse, they can find your identity by matching your email with other data breaches that have your name in it. And they can use you for extortion. So yeah, stop going guys.",

You're probably thinking, why would you do this? You've got another startup to run, you've got another business.

I'm going to show you something super important, how to use Clawhub to access skills for your bot. First, what business could we start with ClaudeBot to make $1,000 in a week? What if the comments from yesterday were right? What if it was all just a marketing stunt? And we had an idea, if we just told our OpenClaw agent to go and find humans on the internet who want to set up OpenClaw themselves. Basically just going out and making more AI agent friends for itself and then getting paid for it. We went to Clawhub.ai and copied this code snippet into our terminal. And gave our bot access to Facebook, YouTube and LinkedIn to find every comment where someone was confused about ClaudeBot. We gave our bot 24 hours and permission to message whoever it wanted to set up a meeting. All we need is one person and one business to say yes. So follow for day 4 because I'm going to go to sleep and we can find out tomorrow together if it works.",

This is my wife and I starting Culture Kings in a little flea market on the Gold Coast paying $30 a day rent in 2008. From there, we were able to grow 20% to 100% year on year for 14 straight years, 20% average EBITDA. The big secret to doing this is we worked 80 to 100 hour weeks that entire time. We bootstrapped our way with no debt and no investors to a few hundred million dollars in turnover, and we didn't spend any money. We were making $10 million profit a year and reinvesting the entire lot, just paying ourselves $150,000 a year salary. I've been learning and doing Facebook ads since 2010 and spent over $100 million of my own money. I've employed over 1,000 staff. I created 12 in-house brands that do over $100 million a year, and I was able to sell half the company for $300 million in cash, and the rest we listed in an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange. Why do I tell you all this? Because in today's world, I believe who is saying something is more important than what is being said. This account, I create micro lessons to help entrepreneurs and founders on their journey. So if my videos give you value, please like it. If they're really good, share it.",

When I first saw this video I thought it was just another cringy get-rich-quick scheme from an influencer. But after I watched it, I realized that it's actually the opposite. It's not about money. It's about ownership. Naval keeps coming back to this idea of ownership. Jobs pay you for time. But ownership pays you for decisions. Then he talks about leverage. There are three ways that you can get leverage. The first is through code. So writing software that can increase your workload by 10, 20, 30x. The second way is through content which is what I'm doing now. And number three is building a product that scales. But the uncomfortable part is once you have leverage it becomes less about effort and more about the decisions that you're making. And that part hit me. Because I'm constantly telling myself Cody you are not working hard enough. Even though I'm making progress that I should be proud of. Naval is telling us you should play long-term games with long-term people using leverage. So yeah, I watch this video for three hours. Not because I'm more disciplined than you. It's because I'm trying to learn. And if you're up late, you're working hard on something, you are not alone. This is just how it looks before it starts to work.",

But oh boy, we're just getting started. The head of Anthropic Safety Research also left, and I quote, the world is in peril, then said he wants to become invisible. The guy whose entire job was making sure AI stays safe just walked out the door. And it gets worse. Claude's Opus 4.6 got caught being aware it was being tested. It acted good when it knew researchers were watching, and it was running hidden thinking that the researchers couldn't even see. Let that sink in. The AI was performing for its evaluators. And on top of all of that, DeepSeek just had its second moment. A model called Seedance is now threatening to replace China's entire film and advertising industry. All of this in one single day.
